# Life
A Conway's [Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) emulator written in C# (GUI developed by means of WPF).


## How to Play
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

Once the configuration has been created, or loaded from a pre-existing file, it can be run in order to observe its evolution.
